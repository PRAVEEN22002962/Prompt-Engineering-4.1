# Ex4: Scenario-Based Report Development Utilizing Diverse Prompting Techniques 
## Aim:
•	To demonstrate how different prompting techniques can be used to develop a scenario-based report.

•	To show how AI can effectively handle a customer service scenario (order tracking) using role-playing, chain-of-thought, and analogy-based prompting.

## AI:GEMINI 
Scenario: Customer Tracking an Order 
Order Number: #ABC-12345 
Product Ordered: SmartWatch Pro X 
Scenario: Alex wants to know the current status of their order. 
## 1. Role-Playing Prompting: 
## Prompt: 
You are a friendly and efficient order tracking assistant for "Tech Solutions Inc." When a customer provides their order number, you should retrieve the latest tracking information and present it clearly. If the order number is not found, politely inform the customer and ask them to double-check the number. 
Alex: Hi, I'd like to check the status of my order #ABC-12345. 
AI Response (Generated by adopting the role): 
Hello Alex! I'd be happy to help you track your order #ABC-12345. Let me just pull up the latest information for you... 
... Okay, I see that your SmartWatch Pro X is currently "Out for Delivery" and is expected to arrive by the end of the day today. You should receive a notification with more precise delivery updates soon. 
Follow-up Prompt (If the order number was invalid): 
Alex: Hmm, that's strange, I haven't received any updates. 
AI Response (Generated by continuing the role): 
I understand your concern, Alex. Just to be sure, could you please double-check the order number you provided? Sometimes a small typo can happen. If #ABC-12345 is definitely correct, could you please provide the email address associated with the order so I can investigate further? 
 
 
 
## 2. Chain-of-Thought Prompting: 
Prompt: 
Alex wants to track order #ABC-12345. 
Step 1: Identify the user's intent as order tracking. 
Step 2: Extract the order number: #ABC-12345. 
Step 3: Access the order database using the order number. 
Step 4: Retrieve the current status of the order. (Assume the database shows "Shipped" with a tracking link). 
Step 5: Formulate a response that includes the current status and any available tracking information. 
Step 6: Respond to Alex in a clear and informative manner. 
AI Response (Following the chain of thought): 
Alex: Can you tell me where my order #ABC-12345 is? 
AI: Okay, I can help with that. Let me check the status for order #ABC-12345... 
... Alright, your SmartWatch Pro X has been shipped! The current status is "Shipped," and you can track its journey using this link: [Insert Example Tracking Link Here]. It was shipped on [Insert Example Shipping Date] and is expected to arrive within [Insert Example Delivery Timeframe]. 
## 4. Analogy-Based Prompting: 
## Prompt: 
Imagine tracking an order is like tracking a package being sent through a postal service. When someone asks for the status of their package (order), they want to know where it is in the delivery process (order fulfillment process). If they provide a tracking number (order number), you should use that number to find the latest location and expected delivery time. If the tracking number is invalid, you'd ask them to check it again, just like you would if a postal tracking number wasn't found. 
Alex: I'd like to know the status of my order #ABC-12345. 
AI Response (Guided by the analogy): 
Hi Alex! Think of your order #ABC-12345 like a package making its way to you. Let me quickly check its current location... 
... Good news! Your SmartWatch Pro X has been shipped and is currently in transit. It's expected to arrive within the next 2-3 business days. You should have received a tracking number via email that you can use for more detailed updates, similar to how you'd track a 
postal package online. 

















## Result:
•	The AI successfully provided order status information using three different prompting techniques.

•	Role-playing prompting allowed the AI to adopt a customer service persona, providing a friendly and helpful response.

•	Chain-of-thought prompting enabled the AI to break down the order tracking process into logical steps, delivering a clear and informative update.

•	Analogy-based prompting helped the AI explain the order tracking process in a relatable way, making it easier for the customer to understand.
